# Event plans

# Shun is in a period of stagnation, corruption and class division is a major issue by the time Cheng Li is emperor in 1836
# After Cheng Li dies:
# 1st born son becomes ruler (Landowners). He will led the Shun to shunsplosion almost everytime, due to his cruel and arrogant character.
# 2nd son (Armed Forces)becomes ruler after a light coup. He can reform the empire but just barely.
# 3rd son (Intelligentsia) becomes ruler during the in fighting of his brothers. He is the reformer type.

# Shun persecution of Christianity
# 1st and 2nd sons will persecute Christans seeing them as a threat to national security.
# The harder the persecution the quicker a Xijao Revolt will spawn
# 3rd son is a bit more opened minded having spend time in euopre.
# This will stop the Hevealy Kingdom, but will come with bad modifers.

# Heavenly Kingdom/Xijao
# Founded by local warlord, Rong Sun, who after contact by Burgundian missionaries converted to his own interpretation of Christianity 
# They will start out only as Jiangxi, but can spread to neighboring countries
# Countries with missionaries will get a JE about these missionaries
# Any revolutionary country with "God-worshipper" as an ideology leader will become part of Jiangxi
# or the revolting states can stay how they are or become a republic.
# Tungning, Shun, and Yunnan will have the option to attack one, none, or all of them. Same with Dai Nam, and Guangdong.
# If Xijao/Jiangxi gets completely annexed , remnants will flee to Zhourao/Qingqiu. Mianjin can get event or JE there about Xijao replacing Catholicism while in Qingqiu they try to establish a utopia further inland.
# The player will be led know about this from the start. No game overs, just tag switchs.

# Nanjing/Wuguo
# Originally a Southern Ming stronghold, ousted by a noble claiming to be descended from the Song Dynasty and crowning himself emperor of the Later Song. However, somewhere along the line the successor was deemed too young/incompetent and effectively became governed as an oligarchic republic governed by these nobles
# A Song-descended guy starts out as an IG leader/agitator. If he gain too much influence Nanjing/Wuguo beocomes the Later Song again; provided the republic don't lose the Phoenix Invasion

# Other
# If Tibet manages to conquer Chongqing/Sichuan they can be seen as a serious contender for the Mandate of Heaven 
# If Dai Nam owns all of Guangdong (including the treaty ports), they can also be a contender
