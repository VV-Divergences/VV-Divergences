 dvg_lusitania.1.t:0 "The Shadow of Mexico"
 dvg_lusitania.1.d:0 "Lusitania's Position"
 dvg_lusitania.1.f:0 "When now-President Deodoro Peixoto declared Lusitania’s independence in order to escape the madness of the Santanderana, neither he nor any other Lusitanian had any illusions that doing so would be enough to secure peace. Soon, Santander will come to take revenge, and if rumors are to be believed then he may be seeking nothing less than a Carthaginian fate for Lusitania. Desperate for allies, Peixoto’s cabinet has proposed that the President swallow his pride and petition the Plantagenians for an alliance. Plantagenia certainly has no desire for a belligerent madman like Santander to place their own nation within striking distance, they argue, which will likely be the result of Lusitania attempting to face Mexico alone. Yet Peixoto knows that the Plantagenians are a greedy people who would likely demand concessions from Lusitania in return for aid. But, his ministers reply, surely bribing the Plantagenians is preferable to what would likely be death at Santander’s hands?"
 dvg_lusitania.1.a:0 "Desperate times and all that…"
 dvg_lusitania.1.b:0 "Lusitania bows to no master!"
 dvg_lusitania.2.t:0 "The Matter of Lusitania"
 dvg_lusitania.2.d:0 "Plantagenia's Dilemma"
 dvg_lusitania.2.f:0 "The implosion of Colombia has led to the creation of several new states, and it seems that the chaos is not over yet. We have received word from Lusitania, formerly northern Colombia, that they seek our protection against the infamous Mexican dictator Agustín de Santander. They have reminded us that, if Lusitania falls, Santander will be at the doorstep of Plantagenia, and his ambition will almost certainly lead him into conflict with us. Our ministers, however, note that Lusitania currently controls the region of Cymrie, which they call Apacheria and which we have desired for quite some time. Thus, they urge us to propose that Lusitania transfer Cymrie to us as a dowry of our alliance. Of course, others believe that we should weaken Lusitania as a precondition for defending it, or that we should not get involved at all."
 dvg_lusitania.2.a:0 "Make the offer: Cymrie for an alliance."
 dvg_lusitania.2.b:0 "We need no bribe to oppose Mexican tyranny!"
 dvg_lusitania.2.c:0 "This does not involve us."
 dvg_lusitania.3.t:0 "The Plantagenian Proposal"
 dvg_lusitania.3.d:0 "Deal with the Frenchmen"
 dvg_lusitania.3.f:0 "President Peixoto’s suspicions of Plantagenian greed were confirmed when he received the reply from our delegation in Nouvelle Orleans : Plantagenia will only form an alliance with us if we transfer Apacheria to them. Our ministers are disgusted at such predatory opportunism, but if we wish to secure Plantagenian assistance against Santander, then this seems to be our only option."
 dvg_lusitania.3.a:0 "Lusitania must survive, no matter the cost."
 dvg_lusitania.3.b:0 "We will not parcel out our homeland!"
 dvg_lusitania.4.t:0 "They Accept!"
 dvg_lusitania.4.d:0 "An Alliance with the Plantagenian"
 dvg_lusitania.4.f:0 "The Plantagenians have agreed to form an alliance against Santander! While we have had to offer certain economic concessions to them to prevent them from demanding any territory from us in exchange, they have concurred with our view that the Mexican despot presents a threat to both of our nations. When Santander comes, we will stand together against him."
 dvg_lusitania.4.a:0 "I never thought I’d die fighting side by side with Frenchmen…"
 dvg_lusitania.5.t:0 "They Refuse!"
 dvg_lusitania.5.d:0 "The Plantagenians declined the offer"
 dvg_lusitania.5.f:0 "The Plantagenians have dismissed our delegation! They declared that our conflict with Santander was not their concern and have left us to our fate. It seems that the only ones who can protect Lusitania are the Lusitanians."
 dvg_lusitania.5.a:0 "As expected from the sons of Frenchmen!"
 dvg_lusitania.6.t:0 "The Matter of Lusitania"
 dvg_lusitania.6.d:0 "Plantagenia and The Colombian Affair"
 dvg_lusitania.6.f:0 "The implosion of Colombia has led to the creation of several new states, and it seems that the chaos is not over yet. We have received word from Lusitania, formerly northern Colombia, that they seek our protection against the infamous Mexican dictator Agustín de Santander. They have reminded us that, if Lusitania falls, Santander will be at the doorstep of Plantagenia, and his ambition will almost certainly lead him into conflict with us. This may be true, but several of our ministers eye Lusitania as a possible future route for our own expansion, and others simply do not wish to get involved."
 dvg_lusitania.6.a:0 "Lusitania calls for aid, and Plantagenia shall answer!"
 dvg_lusitania.6.b:0 "Why defend a strange foreign country of which we know nothing?"
