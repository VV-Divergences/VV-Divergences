 je_qingqiu_reform_into_cooler_federation:0 "Reforming the Federation"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_cooler_federation_reason:0 "Through these reforms we will take control of the provincial armies and curb their corrupt ways by delegating more power to the people, this will allow our federation to prosper!"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_unitary_state:0 "A New Era as a Unitary State"
 je_qingqiu_reform_into_unitary_state_reason:0 "The federal system has worked well in the past, yet the governors don't have the interests of the people in mind, by removing them from the equation we will be able to serve the people directly!"
 je_qingqiu_the_matter_of_the_leages:0 "League Matters"
 
 je_qingqiu_the_matter_of_the_leages_reason:0 "The Leagues of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], represented in the government as the united League of Traders, Shipwrights & Warehouses, rife with internal competition and many commercial ventures across the country, the Leagues are centralised around major trading cities in the country yet often extend their influence to the very frontiers of Qingqiu! This brings both benefits and pitfalls to the government, with their chokehold on almost all commercial aspects of the country, their business is our business too."

 je_mengzi:0 "The Resurgence of Mengzism"
 je_mengzi_desc:0 "Mengzism, or Mencianism, is a philosophical system based on the teachings of Mencius (Mengzi), a 4th-century BCE Chinese philosopher who is one of the most famous Confucian thinkers. Mengzism emphasizes the inherent goodness of human nature and the importance of cultivating this innate virtue through education, self-reflection, and moral development. It promotes the idea that people are born with a sense of compassion and righteousness, which can be nurtured to achieve moral excellence. Mengzism also advocates for benevolent governance, arguing that rulers should lead with virtue and prioritize the welfare of the people."

 qingqiu_federation.1.d:0 "The Status of the Federation"
 qingqiu_federation.1.f:0 "The Federation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] is by no means a well-functioning federation. Our provinces have a great level of autonomy, having differing laws and even their own armies, making governance from  difficult. The provinces are actively working against our federation, making it tough to pass laws and taking a share of the taxes imposed on our people for themselves! However the federation is not without benefits, with our long history of federalism, beginning in the 1600s, we have found what works for the Qingqiuan people. Yet now the question remains; We must reform, but how? Do we reform our federation, or begin a new era as a unitary state?"

 qingqiu_federation.3.f:0 "After years of careful manouvers within our government, pitting the provinces against each other and even considerate military reform in order to further our cause and prolong the success of the Federation! Now after years of struggles we have finally finished with our reforms, the provinces are now demilitarised and serve the people rather than the governors, our people no longer view themselves as Sanbaoers or Dayanites and instead see themselves as Qingqiuian! Now that we have bought stability to the federationn, we can continue onwards and face the enemies that dare threaten our Federation!"

Direct governance from Sanbao begins now, in the name of the people!"

 qingqiu_federation.5.f:0 "Weaving through the mountains, past the gold fields of Dayan and along the Grey River, stretches a band of wood and steel, seemlingly endless should you stand in the middle of it. As the first train begins its journey from Sanbao to Changfeng, our railway builders sit back in Sanbao, proudly looking down the line as the joint Golden Sleeper monuments are built in Sanbao and Changfeng. Now eager passangers and prospectors in Sanbao stand at the platform waiting for the next train to bring them to the goldfields out west, creating a new wave of migration in Qingqiu!"
 qingqiu_federation.5.a:0 "Onwards to Changfeng!"
