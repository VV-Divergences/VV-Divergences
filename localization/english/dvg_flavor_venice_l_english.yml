#  je_venice_and_greece:0 "A Crisis Brewing in Greece"
#  je_venice_and_greece_reason:0 "The Venetian intervention in favor of the Greek Rebellion against the Ottoman Empire during the Ottoman Civil War was crucial in ending Ottoman rule over the Balkans. However, while the support of Venice was crucial in saving the fledging rebellion, the subsequent annexation of Greece by Venice has deeply outraged Greek nationalists and caused unrest throughout mainland Greece. The status quo cannot hold and the promise of Doge Silvestro Dandolo to re-evaluate Greece's relationship with Venice after the war's completion is quickly coming due." 

je_ven_patricians_success:0 "Patrician Entrenchment"
je_ven_patricians_success_reason:0 "In a defining moment of upheaval, radical factions within the Venetian Republic have risen up against the entrenched Patrician elite. Fueled by a combination of nationalist fervor, socio-economic grievances, and a desire for political enfranchisement, the radicals have taken to the streets, demanding an end to the caste-based system and calling for sweeping reforms. This acute moment of revolt marked a significant challenge to the Patricians' grip on power and set the stage for a critical struggle over the future direction of the Venetian Republic. \nThe progress bar will: \n#bold decrease#! by #r 0.1#! per week if you have a radical or reformer in government. \n#bold increase#! by #g 0.1#! per week if you have a Patrician interest group in government. \n#bold increase#! by #g 0.1#! per week if you chose to support positivist reforms and have a positivist in government."

Queen of the Adriatic, Venice's power, wealth, and status have greatly diminished since its heights during the Renaissance.

dvg_ven.118.f:0 "Despite initial hopes for cohesion, factions within the radical movement have experienced a sharp fragmentation, resulting in a loss of momentum and a cloud of uncertainty. Internal disputes over strategy, ideological differences, and competing personal ambitions have eroded the unity once held by the movement.
