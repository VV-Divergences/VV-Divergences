  dvg_italian_confederation.1.t:0 "Towards Italy"
  dvg_italian_confederation.1.d:0 "The majority of North and Central Italy has now been united under our banner. Hopes are high that this will soon lead to a federation of all the Italians."
  dvg_italian_confederation.1.f:0 "Italy has never truly been united. What the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjectiveNoFormatting] state has achieved today is a step towards the impossible and the inevitable."
  dvg_italian_confederation.1.a:0 "The statesmen responsible are national heroes."
  dvg_italian_confederation.1.b:0 "The world will know of our achievement."
  dvg_italian_confederation.2.t:0 "Rise of Neo-Guelphism"
  dvg_italian_confederation.2.d:0 "As the flames of Revolution begin to wither, many intellectuals in our Republic have grappled the Roman question: how to unite Italy with the Pope, head of the Catholic Church claiming temporal power over the Eternal City."
  dvg_italian_confederation.2.f:0 "The Neo-Guelphist solution proposes that Italy be organized as a loose confederation headed by the Pope, which would respect the various laws of the provinces that would join while still forming a united Italian polity. We must now contact His Holiness along with the Milanese duke to see this Confederation exist."
  dvg_italian_confederation.2.a:0 "We should send proposals."
  dvg_italian_confederation.2.b:0 "We should take a different path"
  dvg_italian_confederation.3.t:0 "Proposal of a Confederation"
  dvg_italian_confederation.3.d:0 "As the flames of Revolution begin to wither, many intellectuals in our Republic have grappled the Roman question: how to unite Italy with the Pope, head of the Catholic Church claiming temporal power over the Eternal City."
  dvg_italian_confederation.3.f:0 "A proposal has come from [SCOPE.sC('initiator').GetName]. They have proposed a peaceful unification of the Peninsula in a weak confederation that would be headed by the Pope while preserving the rights of all members and its own laws. This could be an interesting proposal to end the bickering between Italian statelets and avoid a forceful unification like dreamed about by the Savoyards."
  dvg_italian_confederation.3.a:0 "This is a very interesting proposal"
  dvg_italian_confederation.3.b:0 "We are better off alone"
  dvg_italian_confederation.4.t:0 "Formation of the Italian Confederation"
  dvg_italian_confederation.4.d:0 "Italian nationalism has never really gone away despite the end of Revolution in Italy."
  dvg_italian_confederation.4.f:0 "As threats grow, [SCOPE.sC('pap_scope').GetName], [SCOPE.sC('tus_scope').GetName] and [SCOPE.sC('lom_scope').GetName] have decided to join in a Confederation that will be headed by his Holiness. The rights of all states adhering to the Confederation will be respected, with the Confederal government only in charge of war, trade and diplomacy. This Confederation is already very criticized, notably in Savoy who has been a prime opponent of the project."
  dvg_italian_confederation.4.a:0 "One Italy!"
  dvg_italian_confederation.5.t:0 "Failure of the Council"
  dvg_italian_confederation.5.d:0 "The Council we had assembled to create a new Italian Confederation ended after the refusal of several members to join."
  dvg_italian_confederation.5.a:0 "It was just a dream after all"
