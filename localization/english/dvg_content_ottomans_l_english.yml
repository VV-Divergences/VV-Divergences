 ottoman_consolidation_events.1.t: "Centralising Our Rule"
 ottoman_consolidation_events.1.d: "Removing both sectarian barriers in our society and borders between our peoples, the nation is united"
 ottoman_consolidation_events.1.f: "With the centralisation of the nation comes the redundancy of the Khedivates.
