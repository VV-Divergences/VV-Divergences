 seizing_collasuyu.1.t: "Settling the Collasuyan Ranges"
 seizing_collasuyu.1.d: "We have completed our long campaign to secure the ranges for our nation. Settlers are beginning to seek out promising sites from which to establish new towns and exploit the region's natural resources."
 seizing_collasuyu.1.f: "The Mapuche fought long and hard for centuries to protect their lands from us. Now at last they are defeated, and the lands of Collasuyu are indisputably ours. Now we must set ourselves to the task of populating and governing what we have won."
 seizing_collasuyu.1.a: "Collasuyu is ours, only the cone remains!"
 
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.t: "The New Neighbor In The West"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.d: "The Empire of the Inca has recently inflicted a cataclysmic defeat upon the Beornians and reduced them to the region of Avalon. We now find ourselves at the doorstep of a resurgent expansionist power which no doubt has designs upon our lands as well."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.f: "Beornian refugees are already fleeing across the border telling tales of being driven from their homes by the Inca and now the Anglo-Lotharian population is demanding that we take revenge and destroy the “Inca menace” before they destroy us. Attempting to take down such an imposing empire would be a Herculean task so we must carefully consider if it might not be better to seek some type of lasting arrangement with Tawantinsuyu."
 
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.a: "Beornia was and will be Lotharian, and Lotharian only!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.b: "Let's arrange a coalition."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.1.c: "On second thought, let's opt for a diplomatic arrangement instead."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.t: "An Anti-Inca Coalition?"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.d: "Following our conquest of Beornia, Lotharingia has pledged to liberate its former ally by bringing together a coalition of Amerigan nations against us."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.f: "The Knights of Albion have become the figureheads of anti-Incanism across eastern Ameriga. Spreading tales of Inca atrocities and dire warnings about Tawantinsuyu's expansionist aims and its belligerent leader, Sapa Inka Washkar they have stoked the flames of fear into an inferno. As the most extant victim of Inca aggression, we have agreed to host a diplomatic conference in Grand Rivière in cooperation with the Knights to organize a grand coalition against the “enemy of peace and Amerigan freedom known as the Inka Empire.” Invitations are going out across southern Ameriga and even some European powers are considering to send delegates. This could be the greatest war Ameriga has ever seen."
 
 dvg_inca_ameriga.2.a: "The hour of our revenge draws near..."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.t: "Invitation to the Grand Riviere Conference"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.d: "Following our conquest of Beornia, Lotharingia has pledged to liberate its former ally by bringing together a coalition of Amerigan nations against the Inca."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.f: "The Knights of Albion have become the figureheads of anti-Incanism across eastern Ameriga. Spreading tales of Inca atrocities and dire warnings about Tawantinsuyu's expansionist aims and its belligerent leader, Sapa Inka Washkar they have stoked the flames of fear into an inferno. As the most extant victim of Inca aggression, we have agreed to host a diplomatic conference in Grand Rivière in cooperation with the Knights to organize a grand coalition against the “enemy of peace and Amerigan freedom known as the Inka Empire.” Invitations are going out across southern Ameriga and even some European powers are considering to send delegates. This could be the greatest war Ameriga has ever seen."
 
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.a: "We shall slay the Inka Beast!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.3.b: "What, me worry?"

 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.t: "The Great Amerigan War"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.d: "The contracting Powers declare together that they regard the actual situation of Amerigan territorial integrity as a matter of communal interest for the nations of both Europe and Ameriga."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.f: "Animated by this interest they resolve to seek the most efficacious means for the restoration in utmost haste of the foundations of peace suiting to the rights of the nations and favorable to the well-being of the Inca. Thus the Powers are determined to act promptly and unanimously with the forces necessary for realizing this goal.” – Declaration of Grand Rivière \n \n Since the first clash between the Inca and the Spanish Empires, Tawantinsuyu has struggled against the foreigners. Now the newest chapter in that struggle is about to be written with the blood of thousands of Amerigans. An international coalition has assembled to dismantle the realm of Sapa Inca Washkar while he seeks to make himself master of the continent. The fate of Ameriga shall be decided upon the battlefield."
 
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.a: "The future of Ameriga belongs to the Sapa Inca!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.4.b: "Let's wait for them to strike first."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.5.t: "The Sacking of Fort Lothère!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.5.d: "Years ago, a group of Granadan and Quitenese barbarians brought hideous carnage to the holy city of Cusco. While they were defeated the act dealt a heavy emotional blow to the empire. Now our armies have taken revenge upon the European hordes by laying waste to the Lotharingia's capital Fort Lothère."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.5.f: "The Inca seizure of Fort Lothère has seen a series of atrocities play out the likes of which surpass even the darkest days of the Lotharingian Civil War. Inca forces tired and ill-tempered for having marched all the way to the Atlantic coast were given free reign of the city by Sapa Inca Washkar. The result was a cavalcade of rapine and slaughter with Inca soldiers toppling statues of Chef de Aigle and King Edward, carting away their remains completely pillaged by Inca soldiers before by accident or vile plan a fire was started which burned the whole building down. The unprecedented devastation of Fort Lothère has spread despair across the nation and bodes ill for any chances of coalition victory."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.5.a: "Whatever was sacred to these savages could not save them."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.t: "Question of Lotharian Lands"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.d: "Ever since its violent birth, Lotharingia was ruled by Denis de Aigle, a corrupt, oppressive despot who masqueraded as a hero of liberty. Now, that is no longer true as he was found dead in his Fort Lothere bunker before our troops could get to him."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.f: "Although he is now dead and managed to escape the fate of his Beornian counterparts, de Aigle will forever live in infamy among Lotharingia's indigenous population. A key part of his rule was touting Lotharingia as a land of economic opporunity in which his regime would grant millions of European settlers their own plots of land, at the expense of the Guarani people who were forced to live on the 'reservation' that was the barely habitable wasteland of Grande Chaco at the country's western frontier. Now, this policy can be reversed. Surely, taking down all those statues of a jingoistic despot meant something."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.a: "These new lands will be returned to their rightful, original owners- the Guarani people."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.b: "These new lands will be no different than any other state in the Inca Empire and will be wonderful for the spread of our culture and religion."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.6.c: "There's already too many non-indenous people here, let's just give the local majorities some autonomy instead."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.t: "The End of Amazonie"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.d: "For many years, the part of Ameriga known as "Amazonie" had struggled on the question of race - the Antarcticans who wanted a classist state with Whites ruling over an enslaved class of Black people and the Equinoxiens who wanted a more equitable power dynamic between the two races. Now, neither of them matter."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.f: "Upon the surrender of the Equinoxien and Antarctican forces, Antarctican leader/planteur Beaumont Cartier proclaimed he will fight til the bitter end as the "Protector of the White race" in his dying breaths during a last ditch shootout on his sugar plantation. His Equinoxien counterpart, Robert Forrestier, told his captors that his God will punish us all in due time right before he was executed at the very same church he preached at for decades. \n \n Now, with these firebrands gone, we have the opportunity to settle this question of race in a different way."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.a: "These new lands will be returned to their rightful, original owners- the Tupi people."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.b: "These new lands will be no different than any other state in the Inca Empire and will be wonderful for the spread of our culture and religion."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.7.c: "There's already too many non-indenous people here to begin with, let's just give the local majorities some autonomy instead."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.t: "The Coalition Triumphant"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.d: "Hundreds of years ago Sapa Inca Pachacuti enlightened his people by teaching them of Inti and how best to give praise to the sun. Now, like Icarus of the Greek myth, they flew too close to the sun and have been sent plunging into the abyss below"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.f: "The armies of the coalition defeated the Inca armies after a series of maneuvers along the frontier allowed them entry into the imperial heartlands. Sapa Inca Washkar was cornered by the Coalition armies near Lake Titicaca and perished while leading the final charge against them. After a relative of Washkar was hurriedly coronated as the new Sapa Inca he was made to sign an exorbitant and punitive peace treaty. Tawantinsuyu has been dismembered and surrounding nations have stripped away imperial lands. The Inca lands which remain have been devastated by war."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.a: "The sons of Inti have perished."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.9.b: "The sons of Inti have perished."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.10.t: "What does it mean to be Andean?"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.10.d: "As country has now become the entity known as  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the question has arisen on what kind of country we are."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.10.f: ""
 dvg_inca_ameriga.10.a: "We are a melting pot."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.10.b: "We are a salad bowl."



 dvg_inca_ameriga.11.t: "A Divided Ameriga"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.11.d: "It seems that the Euro-Amerigan nations were unable to stay united in the face of war and have collapsed into civil war. The question remains on how to deal with the now much more divided lands of Amazonie and Lotharingia."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.11.f: "For those who know the history of colonization, this is a very familiar offer. After all, their ancestors were able to make similar arrangements with the natives when they came to Ameriga from Europe. Now, as natives of the continent we are here to return a corresponding favor. Already, there are Incan delegations waiting heading to the capitals of the Euro-Amerigans, equipped with treaties laid out in Quechua - not that they'd have any government officials who really understand the nuances of it of course. Details still to be decided."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.11.a: "Let's just maintain a status quo for now."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.11.b: "Demand they all submit."

 dvg_inca_ameriga.12.t: "A New Uniter?"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.12.d: "As Amazonie and Lotharingia have both collapsed, Euro-Ameriga's great adversary, the Incan Empire, has offered to protect our sovereignty - under their banner. "
 dvg_inca_ameriga.12.f: "For those who know the history of colonization, this is a very familiar offer. After all, our ancestors were able to make similar arrangements with the natives when they came to Ameriga from Europe. Now, another group of natives is here to return a corresponding favor. Already, there is an Incan delegation waiting to hear our response in the capital, equipped with a treaty laid out in Quechua - not that we have any government officials who really understand the nuances of it of course."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.12.a: "All hail our new Incan overlords! Praise Inti!"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.12.b: "We shall not be subjugated!"

 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.t: "The National Language"
 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.d: "As country has now become the entity known as  [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], the question has arisen on what kind of country we are."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.f: ""
 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.a: "We shall speak Spanish - an already international language."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.b: "We shall speak a standardized Quechua - true to our roots."
 dvg_inca_ameriga.13.c: "Everyone in our nation shall one day speak both Quechua and Spanish!"
