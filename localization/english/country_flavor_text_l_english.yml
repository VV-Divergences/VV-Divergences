 PLU_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The great age of piracy in Ameriga had seen various Breton sailors join the pirates because of the suffering they endured on colonial ships. Infamous among them was Barba-Du (Black Beard) who raided successfully several Spanish islands. In the XVIIth century  pirates and smugglers sailed the Amazon river to escape colonial authorities. There they established an outpost among the Manao people  later becoming the city of Ploumanao  which developed as a port of adventurers and escapees  developing their own dialect of Breton colored with the local Arauaki language. The Anglois and Spanish governors heard of the place  but none of the expeditions they sent could successfully claim the place and its people  defeated by the treacherous waters and tropical diseases along with political divisions as to whom the city belonged. Meanwhile the Bretons of the Jungle thrived  dealing regularly with merchants from Saint George and they would keep their particularism and their language well beyond the 19th century"

With changing circumstances in Amazonie however, Equinoxea's status as a safe haven for Afro-Amerigans might be threatened." 
 AMA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Priding itself on being the first, recognized democratic country in Ameriga, Amazonie takes pride on being a beacon of liberty in the New World. Nonetheless, the country is still divided over how it will define liberty for its increasingly diverse populace and reoncile with the debate over slavery." 
 BEO_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Beornia as its own entity was founded by English settlers from Burgundian Lotharingia wanting to preserve their culture. Being largely agrarian, remote, and sparsely populated, it is not particularly well-known. Among those who are aware of its existence, it is seen as an underdeveloped, backwater country. However, as the recent coronation of King Edward marks the beginning of the Edwardian Era, can Beornia preserve its integrity while finding a place on the world stage?"
 ATL_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once a borderland between Amazonie and Lotharingia, the discovery of gold in this region made it much more valuable. As a result, it now exists as a neutral buffer state controlled by Spain. As the gold mines deplete however, there are growing calls for Atlantians to be able to determine their own future." 
 LOT_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "After winning a civil war following independence from Burgundy, Denis de Aigle was able to consolidate power and rule over one of the first independent states in Ameriga with the help of his Beornian allies. However, will this republic hold to become a shining example for its neighbors or doomed to collapse from corruption and nepotism?"

 BRG_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Burgundy once swore fealty to the Kings of France, but its entertaining of independence was always there. Phillip of Burgundy stopped the entertaining of the notion, and put it into action while carving out a great swathe of land and eventually created the crown and title Rex Burgundicum through force of will and arms. Today Burgundy is much the same, grown slightly to include greater amounts of the Dual Monarchies' land and slight increases in German lands under its direct control. As the industrial revolution gains more momentum, and Burgundy seems poised to gain more land, it may yet eclipse the Dual Monarchy in strength and come to be the dominant power in the world."
 SCA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Scandinavia is a country that has slowly assimilated all Nordic people into one united culture, along with one united people.

 MSO_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "In 1836, the Lyapunov principality of Moscow is the rising star of Central Russia. The country has recently celebrated a victory against Yaroslavl, the defection of a Smolensk noble confederation in Vyazma to Moscow, too distant for Warsaw to intervene. The current ruler, Peter III Lyapunov has been married to the daughter of Maximillian III Habsburg, ruler of the Commonwealth, under the auspices of the philo-polish boyars. Many saw this move as an unprofitable match with Europe's sick man and Moscow is seen as a Polish lapdog to the rest of the Russians."
 TVE_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The idea of a united Russia was born under the leadership of the Princes of Moscow, but never realised after the fragmentation of the realm of Ivan III. As Princes betrayed and fought each other, foreign powers and their lapdogs in Novgorod and Moscow carved Russia. Yaroslav had their hour of glory but Kipchak attacks, Polish and Scandinavian support for their enemies and pure incompetence led to an ever changing balance of power between the three principalities."

The current prince, Alexey, is both the brother-in-law of the Prince of Moscow through his wife and cousin of the prince of Yaroslav. Having produced no offspring despite having been married for a decade, both Moscow and Tver hope to inherit the Principality."
 SMO_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Principality of Smolensk is the result of many contentions between Russian states and the Commonwealth. Since the peace treaty that ended the Yaroslavl-Polish War, Smolensk has been part of the Polish sphere of influence and in the last 40 years the title of Prince of Smolensk has been part of the long list of honorifics of the Polish king."
 NOV_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Novgorod is a confederation of various states, princedoms, and republics swearing fealty to "Lord Novgorod the Great", that is the city of Veliky Novgorod and its institutions. The Republic has suffered a terrible blow with the loss of the Republic of Pskov, reorganized as a Scandinavian satellite state following the Neva War that ended in 1709. Now the Republic is at a crossroad: It must centralize and reform its institutions, which would anger the princedoms and republics within its borders who rely on ancient privileges. It must deal with the ambiguous status of serfdom, as the southern Russian states are angered by the protection offered to freed serfs. Will Novgorod wear the mantle of Alexander Nevsky and lead Russia towards a new era, perish under the Scandinavian boot, or suffocate by its byzantine politics?"

The intervention in Greece during the Ottoman Civil War gave Venice control of the Greek heartland, a heartland that now eagerly calls for independence as the Ottoman threat now lays far ashore. While to the West, the winds of Italian nationalism push the various remaining independent Italian states into a conflict that at any moment could crash upon Venice's shores. Will Venice be caught in the crosstides of history or will it survive and sail to ever greater heights."

 CRO_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Illyria is well poised to unite Yugoslavia, having taken Serbia from the Turks years prior. However, there are numerous powerful enemies in the way, and with no strong backer seeking a united South Slavic nation, it is up to the Illyrians themselves to guide the South Slavic people to union."

 MJN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Mianjin Republic is the centre -in all meanings of the word- of [concept_dod_zhourao]. Founded by Christian merchants from Qingqiu, it developed tremendously in the XVIIIth century with the arrival of thousands of Chinese settlers who fled the endemic wars in China. The Republic has withstood assaults from the Red Sultans in the North and established several contacts with the Maori tribes and secured the naval roads to Qingqiu while growing more and more into a proper Little China. However, the rule of the patrician families which hold all the power in the state has provoked a miner's rebellion in the South, leading to the loss of several great towns and mines to the recent League of Yaluo. Mianjin now stands at a crossroad : can they emulate their brethern in Qingqiu to embrace modernity and unite the [concept_dod_zhourao] states? Or should the rule of the rich continue without any reform?"
 ZSA_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Sultanate of Zhusha is the oldest [concept_dod_zhourao] area of settlement. Zhusha has flourished thanks to their position that allows them to control trade coming from Indonesia. Malay and Chinese traders from South-East Asia have brought islam with them, which allowed one powerful leader to proclaim himself Commander of the Faithful and Sultan. However, all the attempts of the Red Sultans to conquer their southern neighbours have been unsuccessful and the court in Butingshan has grown decadent and increasingly reliant on the Dual-Monarchy, and the [concept_dod_anglois], always eager to expand their markets.

 YLO_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Yaluo League is the youngest [concept_dod_zhourao] state, born from miners rebellions against the oligarchy of Mianjin allied with local [concept_dod_hongshan] tribes. While their foundations are still shaky, the League gives hope to the people of the continent for it enshrines democracy and tolerance above all. Their capital already attracts merchants from Burgundy and Scandinavia, but many wonder if the latter intend on staying good trade partners, or if their colony of Vargø is only their first step to a wider colonization of the continent. Yaluo, unique amongst the [concept_dod_zhourao] states, supports equal rights for [concept_dod_hongshan], and a bright and shining beacon of democracy might be in the future for the nation. However, too much reform could polarize the North, and Mianjin's shadow looms greatly over the newly independent nation..."
 YAL_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Though many have converted to islam, the Yalai and other [concept_dod_hongshan] tribes of southern Jiangzhou have long been a thorn in the back of Zhusha, with raids being conducted on an almost yearly basis. However, recent years have seen an uptick in the scale and amount of these raids, and a proper intervention and war from Zhusha does not seem to be too far from the horizon. Time will tell, but it seems the [concept_dod_liushadi] shall be civilized in due time."
 WIR_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Kamilaluoyi, and the numerous other tribes of Ruisha, fought against Mianjin in the first Kongsi war, but refused to join the Guli confederation out of fear of the end of their way of life, and have been fiercely resisting [concept_dod_zhourao] encroachment into the [concept_dod_liushadi] ever since."

 NNG_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "European influence looms large, as many of the Noongar have converted to Protestantism, a consequence of missionairies and tribal elders looking to gain European weapons and support. The Noongar tribes are the most advanced of the decentralized areas of [concept_dod_zhourao], with them perhaps being only a few more decades from uniting into a confederation, similar to the Guli in the east. However, Burgundy's colony in Cap Weltevree threatens to break them before they can reach such a point."

 YLN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Yolngu Sultanate is best described as an empire, ruling over a diverse group of tribes, with power emanating from their seat of power in the east. They have become rich off of the trade of gold to the Makassarese in Kayu Jawa, and adopted Islam over the course of the four hundred years of contact since the discovery of [concept_dod_zhourao]. Well poised to unite the region, they have been stalled by the unification of the Marra, as well as the Wadjiginy Sultanate. Now, at the height of their power, [concept_dod_anglois] intervention threatens to spell doom for not only Yolngu, but all three states."
 NGL_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Wadjiginy Sultanate has expanded gradually thanks to their trade with the Makassarese port of Kayu Jawa, however, they now are threatened by the rising Yolngu Sultanate, as well as [concept_dod_anglois] intervention into the region."
 GWG_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Northern [concept_dod_zhourao] is an area of diversity, with the influence of the Makassarese being felt at every level. Islam flows out of Kayu Jawa, just as Gold flows in. The Marra were once seperated into a miriad of tribes and sultanates, however, with the rise of the Yolngu Sultanate to their north, they have united into a federation of Sultans."
 OPS_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Opstalia is not a country in the traditional sense of the word, more of an understanding between the various Geuzen republics that have been proclaimed north of the Vaal river.

 LEW_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Forged in a mutiny led by the bastard son of the viceroy of the cape, the state of Leeuwin leads a tenuous existence. Nevertheless, Aloysius van Afrika maintains grand ambitions to drive the Burgundians out of the cape and unite the Geuzen people under his rule."

However, its leadership is still considered foreign to both the Geuzen settlers who seek to carve up its territory and the indegenous Tswana who want to restore their own sovereignty. Still, there is the possibility it can unite everyone in the Cape under a common flag."

 GEN_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Genoa was once a great maritime and financial power, but those days are long gone. Now Genoa is a shadow of its former self, ruled by a so-called “Duke” Lodovico della Rovere who is far more concerned with funding his lavish lifestyle than saving Genoa. The curtain is calling, and unless something is done, Genoa will fade into the dust of history."
 BEI_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The [concept_dod_voc], a colonial subject of Burgundy in the East Indies, faces challenges including competition from other European powers, conflicts with local rulers and indigenous populations, the difficulty of maintaining control over a large and diverse territory, and navigating the complex political landscape while balancing the interests of its Burgundian rulers and the local population. Despite these challenges, the company has a trade-focused economy with a rich culinary tradition."
 LUC_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Born as a concession to Provence, the duchy of Lucca was carved from Tuscany and ceded by the Farnese. A cousin of the King in France was declared Duke by a "legitimist" uprising orchestrated by the Gonzaga government with the tacit approval of the Florentine government. The creation of the Duchy, not recognized by Provence, was meant to close the matter of Valois claims in Tuscany once and for all. The "Scapegoat Kingdom" did not reach its goals and the King in France continued to claim a region it will likely never control again. The original plan was for Provence to relinquish all claims over Tuscany, followed by a similar move by Florence to renounce all claims outside of Tuscany. This did not happen due to the stubbornness of the King in France, causing instead a new wave of indignation and aggressiveness in Tuscany, putting at stake the life of the young Duchy and the fragile balance in the Peninsula."

 AOT_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Aotearoa is a unified [concept_dod_maoli] state on the North Island. That is, at least, its appearance. It would be more accurately discribed as a unification in name only, forced upon them by the [concept_dod_zhourao]. In the past, the introduction of muskets and gunpowder to the region caused a period known as the '[concept_dod_musket_wars]', from which the [concept_dod_maoli] have only recently recovered, after having their land invaded by a [concept_dod_zhourao] force that centralized the tribes into a confederation. This has led the economic situation of the island to only further rely on Mianjin, and the leasing of Yungang has only exasperated the crisis. Will the [concept_dod_maoli] manage to return themselves to independence, or are they doomed to fall under the thrall of foreign powers?"
 NTO_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Ngāi Tahu, or Tǎhú bù to the Chinese, is the largest [concept_dod_maoli] iwi by area, however, they are not the largest by population. Additionally, numerous other iwis control sections of land in what is represented as Ngāi Tahu. Historically, they would merge together under the moniker of Ngāi Tahu, meaning the People of Tahu. The [concept_dod_musket_wars] have devastated the [concept_dod_maoli], the North, and South. Whilst the North has unified, the South stands divided. The warring has created a great weakness in the [concept_dod_maoli]. A weakness that Scandinavia has proven apt to exploit. Whilst only time will tell, the near future of the people of Tahu is not bright."
 NTU_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Ngāti Koata, or Kētǎ bù to the Chinese, is one of many iwi in the Northern tip of Ny Sjælland. The introduction of gunpowder and muskets caused a period of history known as the '[concept_dod_musket_wars]', which led to some of the bloodiest fighting the island has ever seen. However, whilst the Northern Island's strife led to some matter of unification, in the South, the aftermath of the [concept_dod_musket_wars] has led to a destitute and wartorn land. No victor stands above the South, and the strife against one another looks to be replaced with a conflict for survival. Scandinavia looms large, as does Mianjin from Yungang. The near future, it seems, is not one of glorious unification or westernization. Rather, the only path forward for the [concept_dod_maoli] in the area seems to be one of defeat and destruction."

Should we unite into a single host, we might become one of the great powers of the East, and teach freedom to the oppressive magnates from the Commonwealth and the boyars from Russia."

Being sandwiched between the Arab and Persian homelands, how will Iraq define itself?"
 TRC_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Upon the death of the last great Timurid emperor, Shah Rukh,  the empire splintered into rivaling states - Babur Mirza in Khorasan  Ulugh Beg in Transoxiana and Sultan Muhammad in Ajam. Babur recruited the Timurtash - a Turkmen tribe headed by the ambitious Khan Qutlugh ostensibly to fend off Uzbek raids  although soon they would become an essential component of his military forces  employing them to crush Sultan Muhammad. Soon after they were tasked with facing Ulugh Beg  who crossed the Oxus southwards to restore order to his father's realm. In the ensuing battle  Ulugh was forced to retreat and faced the usurpation of his son Abd al-Latif who blinded him. Babur marched north to conquer Samarkand  proclaiming the blind Ulugh as Shah and becoming the power behind the throne. After the death of Ulugh Beg in 1456  Qutlugh crowned himself as the first Timurid Shahanshah."
 AZB_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Once a vassal of the Timurtash Empire ruling over a small domain in the Kura river valley, Khalil Khan exploited the power vacuum left by the Timurtash collapse by conquering the petty Khanates from Baku to Tabriz.

 TEH_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "The Kar-Kiya domains stretching along the Gilani-Mazandarani shore of the Caspain Sea are isolated by the Alborz mountains from the Iranian Plateau and this inaccessibility has proved to be an asset to the Kiya Amirs - Timur and the Timurtash Shahanshahs a century after him  prefered to delegate rule of this remote region to vassals amirs. Upon the collapse of the Timurtash Empire  the Kar-Kiya enjoyed newfound independence and even expanded south into the populous region of Ajam. Nevertheless  many wonder if the Kiya dynasty hasn't reached its high water mark. The recently ascended Rostam Kiya has inherited an ossified realm with paralysingly corrupt bureaucracy  and increasing religious unrest in Ajam as the Zaydi Shi'ite monarchy attempts to enforce its creed on a population split between Sunnism and the herectic Ismaili and Twelver sects of Shi'a Islam."
 SHZ_FLAVOR_TEXT:0 "Nomadism in the Zagros has its origins in the Mongol ravaging of Iran when the destruction of the irrigation system forced the formerly sedentary Kurds and Qashqai into migrational pastoralism. When the Timurtash Shahanshahs reunited Iranshahr they could only exert limited authority over the Zagros tribes relying on them for local administration and security of the western frontiers. In the aftermath of the fall of the Timurtash Dynasty, Luristan was formally ceded to the Ottoman Empire  although the Sultan never managed to control it - the expedition sent to assert Ottoman authority being crushed by a tribal coalition headed by the Shekbizin. The prestige from the victory against the Turks combined with the capture of Isfahan and the cooption of the Qashqai in Fars allowed the Shekbizin Khan to crown himself Shah. His position however  has never been more than that of a primus inter pares - only Isfahan, Shiraz, and Kerman being really under direct control of the crown.
