 dvg_poland.1.d:0 "Oh, how the mighty have fallen, we, whose domains once spanned all of the lands east of oder."
 dvg_poland.1.f:0 "The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth has been in decline since the XVIIth century. The crown of Poland and Lithuania was forced to give several concessions to the nobility over the centuries making the elected King nothing more than a glorified puppet in the hands of the Magnates holding huge domains where serfdom still prevails. The Union between the crown of Poland and its Ruthenian and Lithuanian territories has weakened as the Hetmans and foreign powers influence the governors of these areas. Poland is not vulnerable to Revolution thanks to a relatively Liberal political situation but if the Magnates aren't kept in check it's hard to see what will happen to Poland"

Many have voiced their concerns and called Ruthenians, lazy, arrogant and unfit called to be citizens of Commonwealth, but those voices now have no power, for King's word is final and we us his loyal subjects must accept Ruthenians as our brothers and sisters."

 #Journal Entries
 je_golden_liberty:0 "Golden Liberty"
 je_eastern_resistance:0 "The Eastern Troubles"
 je_golden_liberty_reason: "The Szlachta has dominated our politics for centuries and they still make a very important part of our politics, but what was once called The Golden Liberty which made Commonwealth a beacon of tolerance and freedom now drags us down like an iron chain, preventing our state from modernizing, to cure our ills we must either curtail Szlachta's privileges or appease them by cementing their position."
 je_eastern_resistance_reason: "The vast swaths of land that make up our eastern holdings have been largely neglected for the most part of our history and what once made up The Great Kyivan Rus now is place of constant Tatar raids and exploitative serfdom of The Szlachta, if we don't end their plight and allow them to flourish within our borders, they eventually will rise up and take the matter into their own hands, which will mean the end of The Commonwealth."

 je_uniting_the_commonwealth_reason:0 "The rebelious dissidents have been defeated, but there's still work to be done. Our eastern domains have grown quite autonomous as the cause of our king's leniency. Now it's time to rein them in and make them kneel before our king!"

 je_pol_king_maximilian:0 "The Death of Maximilian"
 je_pol_king_maximilian_reason:0 "The king of the Commonwealth's 20 years of rule, were mostly marked by his inability to hold any power in his Kingdom. All Sejms convened by Maximilian III were defeated by the use of liberum veto, which allows for any noble to oppose proposals of the Assembly, and the pervading influence of Scandinavia and Bohemia. On his death, the Sejm will convene and the primary candidate, his son Stanislaw is in a good position to succeed him."
